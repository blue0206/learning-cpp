TYPE CASTING
//Converts 'int' to 'double' and vice-versa.
Formula:
int variable = static_cast<int>(double);
double variable = static_cast<double>(int);

Examples:
double change;
int variable = static_cast<int>(change);
//Puts the value of 'change' in 'variable' and converts its type to 'int.'

int change;
double variable = static_cast<double>(change);
//Puts the value of 'change' in 'variable' and converts its type to 'double.'


DEBUNKING DECIMAL FORMULA
cout.setf(ios::fixed)
cout.setf(ios::showpoint)

Here, 'setf' means 'set flags.'
A 'flag' is an instruction to do something in one of TWO possible ways.
If a flag is given as an argument to setf, then the flag tells the computer to
write output to that stream in some specific way. 
The flag 'ios::fixed' displays number in fixed-point notation.
The flag 'ios::showpoint' displays the decimal point of the number.
The word 'flag' is used for something that can be turned on or off.


DISPLAY DECIMAL OUTPUT TO A SPECIFIC DECIMAL SPACE
cout.setf(ios::fixed)
cout.setf(ios::showpoint)
cout.precision(x)             //'x' represents the number of decimal spaces.
For Example:
2.3452342 is displayed as 2.34 when 'x' is 2.


C++ STANDARD LIBRARIES

<string>


<cmath>
sqrt(x) - square root of x (type double).
pow(x,y) -  exponents; x is number, y is power (use of type double recommended).
fabs(x) - absolute value of type float and double.
floor(x) - round-down 'x'.
ceil(x) - round-up 'x'.

<cstdio>

<cstdint>

<ctime>

<cstdlib>
abs(x) - absolute value of type int (example, abs(-4) = 4).
labs(x) - absolute value of type long.
exit (0) - Exits program and prompts for closing.
exit (1) - Exits the program immediately.
//'exit (1)' is used for errors and 'exit (0)' for all other reasons.

<iomanip>
These are functions used after insertion operator '<<'.
For example: endl, setw, setprecision.
setw is just like 'width' member function but is used after '<<'.
Example:
	cout << 10 << setw(4) << 20 << setw(8) << 30 << endl;
	will output the following:
	10  20      30
setprecision is just like member function 'precision' but is used after '<<'.
Example:
	cout.setf(ios::fixed);
	cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
	cout << setprecision(2) << 30.2 << endl << setprecision(5) << 50.4 << endl;
	will output the following:
	30.20
	50.40000

<cctype>
//Must be type "char"
toupper('a') = 'A';
tolower('A') = 'a';
isupper: returns true if uppercase   isupper('a') is false	isupper('A') is true
islower: returns true if lowercase   islower('A') is false	islower('a') is true
isalpha: returns true if alphabet    isalpha('$') is false	isalpha('h') is true
isdigit: returns true if digit	     isdigit('a') is false	isdigit('2') is true
isspace: returns true if whitespace  isspace('4') is false	isspace(' ') is true 	
		     					     isspace('\n') is true isspace('\t') is true


RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION
//Library <ctime> and <cstdlib>
//Put the following code in body: srand (time(0));
//Function srand used only once.

srand (time(0));
int variable = (rand() % 6) + 1;

//The variable expression generates random number from 0  to 5.
//Replace 6 with any number 'n' to generate a random number from 0 to (n - 1).
//Don't place both srand and rand in a loop. Generate srand only once. 
//Generate rand when and you need a random number.


OBJECTS
A variable with a Function and Data associated with it is called an object.
The functions are called 'member functions.'
For example in the following declaration:
ifstream inStream.open("infile.dat");
ofstream outStream.open("outfile.dat");

inStream and outStream are objects with function open associated with them 
and data inside the .dat files. Both objects have different functions even
though the names are same (i.e. 'open'). Both function are slightly different.


CLASS
A 'type' with an Object as Variable is called a Class.
In the above example, ifstream and ofstream are class with objects inStream
and outStream as variables.
The object's class determines which member functions the object has.
